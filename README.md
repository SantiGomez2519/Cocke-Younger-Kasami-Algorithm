## Description

This code implements the CKY algorithm to determine whether a string can be generated by a context-free grammar in Chomsky Normal Form. It reads the grammar’s production rules and a set of strings, then uses a dynamic table to check if the string can be derived from the start symbol. If the start symbol is found in the cell covering the entire string, the string belongs to the grammar; otherwise, it doesn’t.

 ## Instructions to run the code
 - to use this code, must write in the input in the folllowing order, also, each time you enter what is requested in the line, press enter and continue typing:
   
   1. number of cases
   
   2. two numbers k and m in a single line separated by a blank space. Here,k is the number of
   nonterminals and m is the number of strings to be analyzed.

   3. Write your grammar productions, one line for each production and every production must follow the rules of Chomsky normal form. with the following format:

    < **nonterminal** > < **derivation alternatives of the nonterminal separated by blank spaces** >

   4. Finally, m lines each one with a string to test.
